# How to Contribute

## Branch Organization

We have two main branches ```master``` and ```develop```.

The ```master``` branch evolves along with the production environment, so every line of code you will find on the master branch will be the one that is deployed at that time in production.

The ```develop``` branch is the staging environment. This environment is a nearly exact replica of prodcution. This allows us to test every code change in a production-like environment.


## Proposing a Change

If you intend to change the public application or make a non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend to open an issue.
This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.


## Sending a Pull Request

Submit all changes to develop. The team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it or close it with an explanation. As a small team, there may be delays in providing feedback on pull requests but we'll do our best to provide it as soon as possible.
Once you submit your pull request, you can test your changes in a test environment hosted on Heroku


## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SkyRibaudoF/Veritas-client/issues). to track any problems. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesnâ€™t already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to file an issue and provide guidance to reproduce the problem.
